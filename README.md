# 🛡️ Custom uBlock Origin Filters

Hey everyone! 👋

This is where I share my custom uBlock Origin filters. They're my personal touch to make browsing less of a hassle. I've started with a small list, but as I keep surfing and finding more things to filter, I'll keep updating this repo.

## 📜 Filter List

Below is the list of filter files I've compiled. Right now, it's a short list, but keep an eye out for updates!

## 🚀 How to Use

Here's how you can use these filters with uBlock Origin:

1. Click the uBlock Origin icon in your browser.
2. Open the dashboard by clicking the settings icon (a gear or three sliders).
3. Navigate to the "Filter lists" tab.
4. Scroll down to the "Custom" section.
5. Click "Import..." and paste the URL of the filter list you want to use. (You can find the URLs in the table above.)
6. Click "Apply changes" or "Update now", and you're good to go!

## 🧐 About Compatibility

These filters are crafted for uBlock Origin but they might also play nice with AdGuard (not tested, so try at your own risk). If you're feeling adventurous, give them a whirl and adjust as needed!

## ❗ Disclaimer

Remember, these filters are based on my personal browsing preferences. They might not be a perfect fit for you.

Thanks for stopping by! 🌟
